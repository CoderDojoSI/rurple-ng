Rurple NG is a reimplementation from scratch of Andr√© Roberge's marvellous
RUR-PLE: http://rur-ple.sourceforge.net/

This is an early release of RUR-PLE.  On top of the failings listed in the manual, the biggest thing it lacks is a working build system.  In order to get a working build of the Windows installer you need to follow the following steps:

- Build the manual.  This is all the "SConstruct" file supplied currently does, and it currently uses a Linux specific hard-coded path for finding the relevant DocBook style sheet.  Running an XSLT processor by hand should work equally well; the manual should end up in "build\html\index.html".

- Build the executable with "python setup.py py2exe".  You will need py2exe and the wxPython library.  

- Run "build.bat" to build the installer.  You will need WiX installed.

I'd very much like to wrap all of these steps into the SConstruct file in a way that works under Windows.  I'd also of course like to produce a .deb file suitable for Debian and Ubuntu based systems.  Help in this area would be very much appreciated.
